Eventually, the expansion of his inner awareness enabled him to experience oneness with\n the Earth itself, and with the planets and stars which, like the individual human being, undergo cycles of\n life and death—forming and coming together, dissolving and ceasing to be.

As physical\n function declines and consciousness recedes toward the point of irreversibility, what kind of resolve and drama\n are enacted within the inner realm of the individual? How does that person deal with the regrets and satisfactions,\n a final settlement with all that has been painful and bitter, good and rewarding, in this life? In the ideal\n Buddhism offers for the final stage of life, wisdom and compassion figure centrally. An ideal death is one\n in which, supported by others and compassionately engaged with them to the last moments, we are able to sense\n the bedrock reality of our dignity, and can respond to this life's gifts with a profound sense of appreciation\n and gratitude. In this way, we can mark a new and hopeful departure toward the future.",

The experience of many SGI members worldwide stands as proof of this formula.\n People previously mired in cycles of behavior involving, for example, substance abuse, irresponsible sexual\n conduct or violence (or less dramatic but ultimately no less destructive behavior based on a lack of self-respect)\n have reconnected to a genuine sense of inner worth. As this awareness takes root, it naturally grows into an\n awareness of the equal dignity inherent in the lives of other people. Without a conscious effort to follow\n particular rules of conduct, the determination to put this respect for the sanctity of life into action leads\n to a way of life in conformity with the ideals expressed by the precepts.",
